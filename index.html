                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <br>
                <div class="story">
                    <p>Saleh was born in Saudi Arabia, to Bangladeshi parents who frequently relocated for work, before settling in Rochester, New York. He taught himself to program at a young age, and created a variety of online projects such as a website for his family, a teenage social platform and a prank dial service, PrankDial, which generated over $10 million in business, after his graduation from Bentley University. <br><br> When he had grown older, Saleh said that he wanted to create something that "adds legitimate value to humanity". He created his first company while still in high school. He used income from PrankDial to fund his further ventures. PrankDial was somewhat controversial because it was abused as a tool for harassment. <br><br> He went on to co-found the ride company Pathao, which was popular in Bangladesh and Nepal, in 2015. The company was valued at $100 million.<br> In 2018, Saleh also helped found Nigerian Gokada, a Nigerian ride-hail startup for motorbike taxis, that had millions of dollars in funding and gained a lot of traction in the country.<br> The company faced a setback after authorities in Lagos banned motorbike taxis in 2020. <br> Fahim also invested in another ride-sharing company named Picap in Colombia. <br><br>             
                    Friends called Saleh the <em>"Elon Musk of the developing world"</em>. Complex estimated his net worth to be $150 million.</p>
                    <h2>Death</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        On July 14, 2020, Saleh's body was found decapitated and dismembered in his luxury apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Police have said that he was killed the day before. <br>

                        An autopsy report from the Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Saleh died from multiple stab wounds. Detectives have classified this case as a homicide. <br><br>

                        His death caused shock and sympathy from the tech community. Pathao and Gokada praised him after his death; Gokada called him "A great leader, inspiration and positive light for all of us" in its tweet.
